# Drafting NTIA SBOM FAQs

This is NOT the official copy.
This is for awareness and adoption
of the [NTIA SBOM FAQs](https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_faq_20200821.pdf) as part of the [NTIA SBOM](https://www.ntia.gov/SBOM) activities.

GitHub Markdown was used (as opposed to HTML)
for ease in updating by a wider group.
Markdown is intended as easy-to-read, easy-to-write like a plain-text email.


There are 3 branches:
- published - what is at https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_faq_20200821.pdf
- approved - what has been agreed to, but is not yet published on the NTIA website.
- working - still under discussion.

Note that most of the drafting work
will occur in the
Awareness & Adoption Working Group
as part of the
[NTIA Software Transparency Multi-stakeholder Working Group](https://www.ntia.gov/SoftwareTransparency).
GitHub is proposed for change control
and to reach out to a wider audience for comment
once there is consensus within the Working Group.

For those not participating in the A&A WG,
the process would be:
- generate an issue
(https://github.com/sparrell/NtiaSbomFaq/issues/new/choose)
to record a problem or a missing question
- draft proposed text
which ideally would be submitted by a
Pull Request (PR) against the working branch;
- Awareness & Adoption working group
reviews the change at their convenience
and reject, modify, or approve
- approved changes are applied to approved branch
- maintainer closes relevant issue if one exists
- NTIA periodically updates website
from approved branch
and published branch is updated accordingly
