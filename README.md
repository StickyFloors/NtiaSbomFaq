# Drafts for drafting NTIA SBOM FAQs

This is NOT the official copy.
This is for the drafting NTIA SBOM FAQs.

There are 3 branches:
- published - what is at https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_faq_20200821.pdf
- approved - what has been agreed to, but is not yet published
- working - where drafting is taking place.

The process is:
- generate an issue (https://github.com/sparrell/NtiaSbomFaq/issues/new/choose) to record a problem or a missing question
- draft proposed text which ideally would be submitted by a Pull Request (PR) against the working branch; but could be submitted in an issue or sent via email to the list
- PR is created if not already done, including :construction: tag
- Awareness & Adoption working group reviews the change
- working group approves the change
- maintainer approves the PR to working, adds :new: tag and approved branch is updated accordingly
- maintainer closes relevant issue if one exists
- NTIA periodically updates website from approved branch and published branch is updated accordingly
