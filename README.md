# Drafts for drafting NTIA SBOM FAQs

This is NOT the official copy.
This is for the drafting NTIA SBOM FAQs.

GitHub Markdown was used (as opposed to HTML)
for ease in updating by a wider group. 

There are 3 branches:
- published - what is at https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_faq_20200821.pdf
- approved - what has been agreed to, but is not yet published
- working - where drafting is taking place.

The process is:
- generate an issue (https://github.com/sparrell/NtiaSbomFaq/issues/new/choose) to record a problem or a missing question
- draft proposed text which ideally would be submitted by a Pull Request (PR) against the working branch; but could be submitted in an issue or sent via email to the list
- PR is created if not already done, including :construction: tag and applies to working branch
- Awareness & Adoption working group reviews the change
- working group approves the change
- maintainer changes :construction: tag into :new: tag and approved branch is updated accordingly
- maintainer closes relevant issue if one exists
- NTIA periodically updates website from approved branch (after removing :new: tags and formating as desired) and published branch is updated accordingly
