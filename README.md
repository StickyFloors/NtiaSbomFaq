# Drafting NTIA SBOM FAQs

This is NOT the official copy.
This is for the drafting NTIA SBOM FAQs.

GitHub Markdown was used (as opposed to HTML)
for ease in updating by a wider group.

There are 3 branches:
- published - what is at https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_faq_20200821.pdf
- approved - what has been agreed to, but is not yet published
- working - where drafting is taking place.

Note that most of the drafting work
will occur in the
Awareness & Adoption Working Group
as part of the
NTIA Software Component Transparency
Multistakeholder process.
GitHub is proposed for change control
and to reach out to a wider audience for comment
once there is some consensus within the Working Group.

For those not participating in the A&A WG,
the process would be:
- generate an issue
(https://github.com/sparrell/NtiaSbomFaq/issues/new/choose)
to record a problem or a missing question
- draft proposed text
which ideally would be submitted by a
Pull Request (PR) against the working branch;
but could be submitted in an issue
or sent via email to the list
- PR is created if not already done,
including :construction: tag
and applies to working branch
- Awareness & Adoption working group
reviews the change
- working group approves the change
- maintainer changes :construction: tag
into :new: tag and approved branch
is updated accordingly
- maintainer closes relevant issue if one exists
- NTIA periodically updates website
from approved branch (after removing :new:
tags and formatting as desired)
and published branch is updated accordingly
